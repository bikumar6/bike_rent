# Web Programming

## Motivation
- To develop a website that provides useful information to poeple rather than a simple website, it was proposed to develop a website based on the 'sharing economy business (*)'.
  * A expression that refers to economic activities by recognizing goods as a concept of borrowing and lending, rather than owning. ex) Uber, Airbnb
- The item to share was selected as a bicycle purchased by students at the university and rarely used (owned by someone but not used).
- So, the proposed website is named as Meaningcle, which is a combination of Meaning (representing meaningful actions in terms of sharing resources, not a general sales webiste) and Bicycle.
